My project is about anti-body shaming and the promotion of forcing its existence out entirely. My focus is on the model 

who is "boxing" or "hitting" the body shaming name calling away. There are celebrities I am using who have spoken out about 

being body shamed by critics. There will be models, actresses and singers who will be featured. So far, I have model Ashley

Graham and actress Lili Reinhart, both who have been vocal about people saying something negative about their weight. Model

Gigi Hadid is the one trying to box away the haters. In addition, I will feature other female celebrities. I also want to

put words such as "skinny," "chunky," "skeleton," "eating disorder," over their eyes or on each person as a way of taking

these labels people throw out on these celebrities and see them disappear along with the concept of body shaming itself. 

I'm still trying to figure out of the background I currenly have fits the theme or if I need to find a different one that

will speak more about the message I'm advocating. I want to put text at the bottom that says something along the lines of

"hit the road bodyshamers," or "box the haters; love your body." I know those probably don't sound the best, but I'm

still in the process of coming up with a better one.
