This magazine cover is promoting anti-body shaming. The problem of body shaming continues is still around and needs

to disappear. Celebrities in the media continue to face the wrath of critics who have negative things to say about

their appearance. I can relate, because I have been labeled by my peers as "too skinny," therefore inspiring the

magazine cover I've creaed. I mirrored it after a Cosmopolitan issue and what you would see on the cover. I Googled 

celebrities who have been vocal about body shaming and was surprised by  the results. Many of which you'd never 

expect to be targeted have been and have the courage to stand up against body shamers. I wanted to use a variety 

of celebrities who have different occupations and come from various backgrounds to emphasize the importance of 

recognizing diversity and body positivity. People nowadays find using the media to lash out is easiest because 

they are saving face by hiding behind a screen. Along with the celebrities you see are quotes that internet 

users have said to them. I made Gigi the main focus because she is "punching" the naysayers and their opinions. 

She, too, has been body shamed. You also see a tape measurer wrapped around the celebrities, as that is what 

people use to measure themselves. The theme of this cover is about boxing and getting rid of both the critics 

and body shaming. I used boxing terms such as "punching" and "knockout" to highlight how forceful these women 

must be to put the critics in their place. I also put a call-to-action hoping readers feel inclined to join the 

celebrities and put an end to body shaming. It has been in existence far too long and needs people to advocate 

against it.
