This magazine cover is promoting anti-body shaming. The problem of body shaming continues is still around and needs

to disappear. Celebrities in the media continue to face the wrath of critics who have negative things to say about

their appearance. I can relate, because I have been labeled by my peers as "too skinny," therefore inspiring the

magazine cover I've created. I mirrored it after a Cosmopolitan issue and what you would see on the cover. I Googled 

celebrities who have been vocal about body shaming and was surprised by the results. Many of them you'd never 

think would be targeted that have been and had courage to stand up against body shamers. I wanted to use a variety 

of celebrities who have different occupations and come from various backgrounds to emphasize the importance of 

recognizing diversity and body positivity. People nowadays find using the media to lash out is easiest because 

they are saving face by hiding behind a screen. Along with the celebrities you see are insults that internet 

users said to them. I made Gigi Hadid the main focus because she has been body shamed the naysayers and 

their opinions. You also see a tape measurer wrapped around the celebrities, as that is what people use 

to measure themselves. The theme of this cover is about boxing and getting rid of both the critics and body shaming. 

I used terms such as "punching" and "knockout" to highlight how forceful these women must be to put the critics 

in their place. I also put a call-to-action hoping readers feel inclined to recognize the ongoing issue, join the 

celebrities and put a stop to body shaming. Its existence is alive today and has been for far too long. Even if you

never experienced body shaming, others have and it's important to stand by them and fight for what is right.
